# ai-trust-study
This repository contains the question set and AI response variations used in my CS 312 final project on how anthropomorphic design cues influence trust, confidence, and reliance on AI systems. The dataset includes 12 multiple-choice questions paired with four different AI “personas,” each representing a different level of anthropomorphism:
1. Minimal Bot – no human cues
2. Name Only – human-like name
3. Polite Tone – warm and friendly phrasing
4. Name + Avatar – human identity + social presence
All four personas give the same factual answer to isolate the effect of presentation/design on user trust.
